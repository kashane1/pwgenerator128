Process:
-----------
My original intention was to make a bare bones webpage for my portfolio and then update it in the following months. But I enjoyed the process too much and wanted to fill out the whole page as best as I could. I still have plenty more to add, but for now my portfolio gives a good teaser of my software engineering capabailities. 

-----------
Extra:
-----------
1. I tried to incorporate new css that we learned as well as javascript
2. I added a fun easter egg or two in there!
