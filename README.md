1. The password generator will prompt the user to select all the criteria for their password.

Process:
-----------
As all processes start, I thought out as many steps as I could and started to draw up a basic program both in my head and in code. Having the final project in mind is a clear way of thinking out and writting code. I worked through the whole program almost flawlessy, until one of the last sections that includes the for loop. I had forgotten to use Math.floor() in front of Math.random() I actually had to take a break from the computer and come back with fresh eyes in order to see my error.
